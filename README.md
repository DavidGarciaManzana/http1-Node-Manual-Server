# http1-Node-Manual-Server

This is an HTTP 1 server created manually using Node.js and TypeScript. It functions by launching a server with three files: a TypeScript (ts) file, a Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) file, and an HTML file. By executing 'npm run dev,' you can launch this minimal app as a web server.
